[TSDocs.dev](https://tsdocs.dev) is a service that lets you browse type reference documentation
for Javascript packages.

It works even with packages that aren't written in Typescript (sourced from DefinitelyTyped)
or when packages re-export types from other packages.

Its depends heavily on a customized version of [typedoc](https://github.com/TypeStrong/typedoc)
for generating API docs documentation.

## Writing good documentation for your library

`tsdocs.dev` extracts documentation from the type definitions that ships with libraries. In case a type definition is 
unavailable, it searches [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) for the closest equivalent.

For an example, see documentation for d3 â€”
https://tsdocs.dev/docs/d3/7.8.5/classes/FormatSpecifier.html

Internally tsdocs.dev uses a customized version of typedoc to parse 
and render documentation, which works on docstrings and markdown
https://typedoc.org/guides/doccomments/
